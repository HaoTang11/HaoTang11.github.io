- we propose a robust 2D-3D correspondence method based on the covariance of the pose.
- we determine the asteroid pose by minimizing the angles between the projection planes of the extracted 3D contour segments and the back-projection lines of the corresponding 2D edge points.
- we infer the covariance matrix of the estimated pose based on the first-order optimality of the pose optimization.
- we use 2nd-AR-based SCKF to give the final pose estimate and initialize the pose tracking at the next time instant.

A Robust Template-based 3D Pose Initialization for Spacecraft by 2D Contour optimization

 **Hao Tang**, Chang Liu*

under research

**Paper**

The initial value of pose is crucial in the process of target tracking. This work mainly uses the template library generated by the target CAD model to estimate the initial pose of the target monocular image sequence. Compared with traditional template matching algorithms, our method does not rely on the PNP algorithm, require a smaller template library, exhibits greater robustness, and achieves higher estimation accuracy. 

Specifically, we improve the neural network SFSnet to segment the spacecraft from the input image and match the segmentation result (the 2D contour) of the input image with the binary image template library. We then apply the low-frequency information extracted by Fourier analysis of the 2D contour and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to calculate the 2D pose and scaling factor between the input image and the template image. These parameters are used to derive a closed-form solution for the 3D pose, which serves as the initial estimate for a nonlinear optimization algorithm to further refine the pose estimation. Finally, we employ a Hidden Markov Model to optimize the pose estimation from several neareast neighboring solution and obtain the final pose.
